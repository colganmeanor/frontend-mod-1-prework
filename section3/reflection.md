## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- "Focusing on what worked and what didn't, and reevaluating your approach using strategies you've found to be effective is how you grow your coding skills" This section really resonated with me because this is basically the trial and error approach I've taken to each coding exercise so far. I like to just play with it until I can make it work, and rinse and repeat until I understand the concept well enough to progress further.

- "When you see mistakes as critical to learning, you won't feel discouraged when you make a mistake"
This resonates with me because like I mentioned in my previous point, I rely on trial and error to get to the solution. I have almost no expectation that I'll get it right on the very first try. If I was convinced of that, I wouldn't get much further than the first two lines without giving up in frustration.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- One way I currently try to incorporate a growth mindset is to seek help when I'm truly in need. I am no stranger to scouring Google Search results for an answer, or a clue. Several exercises throughout the mod 1 prework I've turned to Google to help guide me.

- I'd say that this is also a way in which I need to grow as well - I'm much more prone to go to Google with questions then ask my peers. I know Google won't judge me for having dumb questions, but in the back of my head I worry that my peers might think less of me I ask a question with a simple answer. So, while I'm comfy with independent research, I think I need to make myself more open to growth through collaboration and cooperation.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- On Youtube, when viewing any specific Youtube channel - you can view a list of videos uploaded by the user. You can organize this list by date uploaded, total number of views, etc. This display on the Youtube channel page might be considered an array, and by choosing a preferred order for the list, it might be telling the site to display the order of the list in different ways.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- an array method is a coding function that performs a change to an established array, for example the .push method which adds a new item to the end of the existing array

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- a loop exists to tell a section of code to run until a certain condition is met. We might use a loop with an array when we want to concatenate data from the array with a new string, and not call each item in the array individually. We could do so using an array with a loop and simplify the code but still get the same output.

- we might use a loop without an array to show simple incremental increases or decreases to simple integers

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- a loop is like your teacher who gives everyone in your classroom instructions. Instead of calling each member of the class up to the room and telling them the instructions one at a time, they simply stand at the front of the room and deliver the instructions to the entire class. Each student knows they need to work on the task without needing to be told individually, one at a time.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- Putting loops together with "if statements" gave me some whiplash - I think I need to practice some more on combining the elements we've learned so far across sections 1 - 3.

- I'm curious to learn more about array methods, and things that can be done with various methods.
