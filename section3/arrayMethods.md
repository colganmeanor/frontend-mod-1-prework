#Array Methods

1. push Array - adds one or more new elements to the end of an existing Array and outputs the new length of the Array after the new elements have been added.

2. pop Array - removes the FINAL element from a given existing Array, and outputs the element to the user in a new line.

3. shift Array - similar to pop - this method removes the FIRST element from a given existing Array, and outputs the element to the user in a new line.

4. unshift Array - adds one or more new elements to the BEGINNING of an existing Array, and outputs the new length of the Array after the new elements have been added.
