## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- *Personally, I found there a lot of value in this article. Some things I already try to do when I’m learning something new - learn in such a way that I can attempt to teach someone back what I’ve just learned. This ultimately helps me build the most confidence and be sure that I know what I’m talking about.

I also try to take healthy amounts of breaks. I know from my previous academic experiences that I do horribly when working long hours without breaks. I appreciate that Turing approaches breaks in a seemingly healthy way.

I know that I need to get more in the habit of doing independent reading and research to try and keep expanding my attention past what we’re going over in the classroom.

I cannot think of anything specific I would add to the list at this time.*

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- Strings - typically simple text values assigned to a variable
- Numbers - assigning a numerical value to a variable
- Boolean - a data type that establishes between True and False

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

- var questionThree = 'Hello World!'
- console.log(questionThree)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

- *You would use "//" to indicate a comment. Tons of possible reasons, you might need to literally display a comment. Or you may use
these forward slashes to prevent a line of code from running.*

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

- A variable is a unit used in Javascript to show anything that can vary, and can store data to show that variance. If I were explaining it to a 5 year old.... :
"a variable is like when you have your friends come over to play after school, and your mom has snacks for each of your friends. Mom has a different snack for each of your friends, and knows that when that friend is over, to give them THAT snack."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- Thinking of the music streaming App - Spotify
 - variables:
 'Song Title' has gotta be a variable - 'string' dataType value attached to show the name of the song.
 'Number of songs in a playlist' is displayed when viewing a playlist - this must be a 'number' datatype to show a number of songs in a given playlist.
 'Online Status' - the app shows when friends and other users are online or offline. I imagine this might be a 'Boolean' value to determine if true or false before showing a user's online status on the friend feed.



7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

- Concatenation is when you bring together 2 or more datatypes into a single output. Typically this is done with strings, however integer datatypes can also be included.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

- I'm imagining a scenario on a retail platform like Amazon - where you get to the order confirmation screen after successfully placing an order, and the message displayed might say - "Colgan, thanks for your purchase. Order 01923812301 is being processed and will ship on July 30th" where they are pulling in multiple variables to provide this confirmation screen to me at the end of the order. My username would be a variable, the order number would be a variable, and the shipping date would be a variable.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- I've started to explore different operator assignments - I'm curious to see how these are used in context.
- Are there cases where you would specifically NOT define a variable? I'm imagining maybe there are in cases where you're waiting on a user to help define that variable for you, but I'm not entirely sure.
