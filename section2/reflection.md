## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- *Generally, I feel good about asking questions. I know that everyone has to ask questions eventually, and that no one is typically amazing or skillful at something without having to ask questions along the way. I also know there is a healthy balance between asking questions that I can figure out the answer to myself, and losing sleep over questions I cannot get answered because I don't have the confidence to ask.*

- *I tend to wait a little too long to ask questions, but I'm trying to get better. :)*

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- *I expected this would be part of the learning experience at some point, so while it added onto my work time a little bit, I didn't mind nor was I super uncomfortable. I did feel good pulling together several resources to get this section of work complete. For example - I actually tested a lot of the function codes in repl.it on my second monitor before placing them into .js files in the section2 directory.*  
- *I also really got a lot of value out of some of the youtube channels I've been finding, and specifically the one linked to in the section readme - this video from "Programming with Mosh" - I found that so helpful to be able to work alongside his videos to get a better sense of how functions worked.*

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- *a conditional statement precedes a block of code and specifies that if certain conditions are met, then a certain action will take place.*
- *a daily life conditional example: if the main street you take to work is closed, then you will take a different street.*
- *an example in a web application: on Youtube, a video will show as unplayed until the user has watched it. If the user has watched the video, then the video will show as having been watched. The question is whether to show the video as watched or not, and it depends on the action the user has or has not taken.*

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- *One way to add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement is by using logical operators. these are represented in syntax by && (which means AND) and || (which means OR).*
- *In a normal programming 'if' statement with one condition, the program checks to make sure that a single condition is satisfied before outputting a certain result. In a situation with multiple conditions, the program checks to ensure that not just one condition, but two separate conditions are satisfied. When using the && (AND) symbol in an if statement, the result is dependent on both conditions being satisfied before a certain result is produced.*

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- *The logical operator tool is perfect for this use case. If you want to check that two of two conditions are met, you can use the && symbol which means AND.*
- *If you want to ensure that ONE of TWO conditions are met, you may use || which means OR.*

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- *I need to research the proper format of if, else if, and else statements. I had to play with my "if" statements a lot to get them working properly for the exercise.*
- *I really like functions, I don't have any questions at the moment about functions. I am starting to see how functions and 'If' statements can work together.*
